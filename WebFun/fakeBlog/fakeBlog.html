        Welcome to my fake blog where you'll learn just a little about one of my hobbies. I hope you enjoy your time with me, as well as getting to know one pastime I enjoy doing. In case you're wondering, that's my awesome family in that picture (but I'm a little
        partial toward them, though).
    </p>
    <p>
        I've been hunting for about ten years now. Prior to then I wasn't interested in hunting at all. I was actually a little against it. My boss at the time, as well as a friend of his were always talking about their experiences hunting. Over time I began
        to see hunting from a different perspective.
    </p>
    <p>
        They helped me to see that hunting is necessary. In America today white tail deer do not have predators anymore. At best vehicles on roadways are the biggest threat to them. Without natural predators, deer herds are in danger.
    </p>
    <p>
        When herds grow too large, it results in several bad effects on their population:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li style="margin-left: 250px">Disease runs rampant and, in recent years, has killed off entire herds</li>
        <li style="margin-left: 250px">Drivers on roadways are in greater danger of hitting a deer</li>
        <li style="margin-left: 250px">Farmers experience significant loss to their crops due to deer</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="img/buck.jpg" alt="Image of a buck" style="height:200px;" align="right" hspace="50px">

    <p>
        For these, and many more reasons, humans must step in and be the predator. It sounded harsh to my ears at first, but hunting is for the good of the deer. Without it, they would be in greater danger, and suffer more from disease.
    </p>

        Some people hunt for a trophy to hang on the wall. Not me, I hunt for the table. Sure, a large buck is exciting, and I've managed to get one over the years. But a trophy isn't my primary target.
    </p>
    <p>
        For me, the final component that got me to start hunting was the freezer. I have five kids, the youngest three are boys. If you have boys, then you understand that they eat a lot. Hunting is a cost-effective way of filling the freezer with healthy, and
        organic meat. Generally speaking, my goal is to fill the freezer each year to help offset the cost of groceries.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, late summer every year, I pull my bow out and get some practice in on the shooting range. Generally, I'm a little rusty after nearly a year not shooting, so it takes a few hours over a few days to get my aim back. I never want to just injure the animal;
        humane treatment is a non-negotiable for good hunters.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have a short checklist I go through at the start of my practice:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Check bow string for defects</li>
        <li>Check bow body and parts to ensure they are in proper working order</li>
        <li>Ensure sight has not become loose</li>
        <li>Check condition of arrows - the knock, feathers, and head</li>
    </ul>
